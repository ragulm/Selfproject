/**
 Singleton holding the registration of various web strategy objects. These are added using strategy resolver objects which are
 responsible for returning a strategy for a given set of parameters. This class effectively manages an ordered list of
 resolvers per authentication type and invokes them in order whenever a strategy is needed. The first non-null object returned is going to be used.
 <p>
 There's always a default resolver which returns the default strategy all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
 Currently, this class supports registration of strategy resolvers for the following authentication types:
 <ul>
 <li>SAML2WebStrategyResolver</li>
 <li>OAuth2WebStrategyResolver</li>
 <li>OTPWebStrategyResolver</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 For simplicity, this class itself implements the above protocols and acts as the main resolver. As such, it is guaranteed to
 return a strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
 Managing strategy registrations is not thread-safe. Callers must make sure that strategy resolver registrations do not interleave with
 actual resolution.
